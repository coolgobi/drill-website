<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br/>
Apache Drill is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further<br/>
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not<br/>
necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
